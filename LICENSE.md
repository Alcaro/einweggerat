 1. Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be a dick.

     Being a dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

	 1a. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy this and change the name. 
	 1b. Selling the unmodified original with no real work work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being a dick.
	     Especially if you mod it just enough to work on some shitty app store.  
	 1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content like viruses and ads. That would make you a PROPER dick.  

 2. If you become rich through decent modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work,
 share the love. Only a dick would make loads off this work and not give the original work's creator(s) a game on Steam. 
 
 3. Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes 
 you a DONKEY dick. Fix the problem yourself. A non-dick would submit the fix back or submit a [bug report](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html)
